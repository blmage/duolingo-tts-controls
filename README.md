### Features

Available soon.

### Keyboard shortcuts

No keyboard shortcut is available for the moment, but it is the number one priority in the roadmap.

### Limitations

* The extension is deeply tied to the inner workings of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com), meaning that any 
  significant change on their side could (temporarily) break it. If that happens, you can either:
  
    * wait for me to fix it (you can
      [open an issue](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-tts-controls/issues/new) if there is none yet about it),
    * try to fix it yourself, then open a related [PR](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-tts-controls/compare).

* Due to hard limitations with the underlying technology (sounds are not accessible via Ajax requests, preventing us
  from using the Web Audio API), the volume can not be raised over 100%.
